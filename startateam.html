                <h2>What is Quizbowl?</h2>
                <p>Quizbowl is an exciting academic competition where teams of students compete to answer questions about various subjects such as history, science, literature, and general knowledge. Participants use buzzers to buzz in and answer questions, testing their knowledge and quick thinking skills.</p>
    
                <h2>How Does Quizbowl Work?</h2>
                <p>In Quizbowl matches, a moderator reads questions to the competing teams. Team members compete to buzz in first and correctly answer the questions. Points are awarded for correct answers, and there are often different rounds and formats used in competitions.</p>
